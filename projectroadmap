# Sprint 1
    1. Turn in approved projet topic
    2. Join KSU-IS organization
    3. Have ownership of a repository within KSU-IS
    4. Edit and commit readme file
    5. Explore and run other Python code relating to my project
        To start, I looked at some other python projects that had to do with stat tracking. I found one that tracks NBA stats that looks very useful (https://github.com/dblackrun/nba-stats-tracking).
        By looking at and running the code, I came up with some ideas to add to my project. Some of these ideas include having percentages of hits, sets, and, serves made rather than just keeping track of misses and makes.
