# Spikeball-Stat-Tracker
This is a program where users can input stats from a Spikeball game or tournament and see what they need to work on.
Users can input stats such as missed serves, hits, and sets, made serves, hits, and sets, put-aways, aces, defensive touches, etc. and find out their Spikeball Player Rating (SPR). Using this, users will be able to see what they are struggling with to allow them to figure out what needs to be worked on. They will also be able to see the progress that they have made from tournament to tournament.

I started out by defining all of the variables that I would need, which ended up being 60 in total. 30 of them were for the totals of multiple tournaments and the other 30 were for each specific tournament. This allows the user to see their progress over time. Next I coded it so that the user inputs data from their games. Using that data, The program would calculate different player ratings for different parts of their games such as serving, defence, efficiency, hitting, and a total player rating. Finally, it would give the user all their info in a user-friendly and readable way.
