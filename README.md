# Spikeball-Stat-Tracker
This is a program where users can input stats from a Spikeball game or tournament and see what they need to work on.
Users can input stats such as missed serves, hits, and sets, made serves, hits, and sets, put-aways, aces, defensive touches, etc. and find out their Spikeball Player Rating (SPR). Using this, users will be able to see what they are struggling with to allow them to figure out what needs to be worked on. They will also be able to see the progress that they have made from tournament to tournament.
